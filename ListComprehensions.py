#List comprehension: it offers a shorter syntax when you want
# to create a new list based on values of an existing list
# list = [expression for item in iterable]
# list = [expression for item in iterable if conditional]
# list = [expression if/else for item in iterable]

# squares = []
# for i in range(1,11):
#     squares.append(i*i)
# print(squares)

#the above code is equals to
# squares = [i**2 for i in range(1,11)]
# print(squares)

#this code equals to

# even = [num for num in nums if num%2==0 ]
# print(even)

# odd = [num for num in nums if num%2!=0]
# print(odd)
